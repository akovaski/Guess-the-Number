Guess-the-Number
================

My simple guess the number game for me to test stuff for other games.
I plan on at least exploring:
* Flash as3
* Flixel
* Kongregate API

I have very little to no experience with any of these, as of this creation.

Done, so what can I claim I put in this simple game?
====================================================
* Fade between states instead of hard transition
* Custom buttons (not all are custom)
* Submit HighScores to Kong using QuickKong
